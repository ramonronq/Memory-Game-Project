# Memory Game Project

This is the last project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program.

# Game play

The object of the game is to open cards by clicking on closed cards and finding a match for each card/icon. There are 16 cards total.
When 8 matches of cards have been found, the game will end.

At the end of the game, a summary will be provided containing:
- how many moves or clicks it took to find the matches
- how much time it took to find all 8 matches
- a rating of 1, 2, or 3 star ratings based on how many moves it took to complete the game

Upon completion of the game, an option to replay or restart the game will be available
